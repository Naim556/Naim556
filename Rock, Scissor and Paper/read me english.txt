General Description:
This code implements a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user can choose one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and compare it with a random choice made by the computer. The game keeps track of the scores for both the user and the computer.

Main Components:
Imported Modules:

tkinter: For creating the GUI.
random: To generate the computer's random choice.
messagebox: For displaying error messages.
Core Functions:

score_reset: Resets the scores of the user and the computer to zero.
rock, paper, scissor: Each handles the user's input, compares it with the computer's choice, and updates the scores accordingly.
User Interface:

The program uses three frames to structure the GUI:
Top Frame: Displays the scores and includes a reset button.
Middle Frame: Displays the user's and computer's choices with images.
Bottom Frame: Includes buttons for selecting rock, paper, or scissors.
Various images are used for buttons and user/computer choices.
Game Logic:

The user's choice is compared to the computer's randomly generated choice to determine the winner.
Scores are updated based on the comparison.
An error message is displayed if an invalid choice is detected.
Images:

The code relies on images stored in the icon\\ directory for visual representation of options and buttons.
